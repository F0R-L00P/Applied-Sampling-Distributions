# Applied-Sampling-Distributions
The term sampling distribution of a statistic refers to the distribution of some sample statistic over many samples drawn from the same population. Much of classical statistics is concerned with making inferences from (small) samples to (very large) populations. The following topics will be covered, each with a simple code snippet.
1. Standard Error
2. Bootstrap
3. Confidance Interval
4. Normal DIstribution
5. Long-Tailed Distribution
6. t-Distribution
7. Binomial Distribution
8. Chi-Square Distribution
9. F-Distribution
10. Poisson

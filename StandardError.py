'''
1) Sampling the Population: 
    you first take samples from the population. For instance, from a population of 1,000,000, 
    you might take 5 samples, each consisting of 1,000 individuals.

2) Calculate the Mean of Each Sample: 
    calculate the mean for each of the 5 samples. Each sample will have its own mean.

3) Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Sample Means, Not Individual Samples: 
    don't calculate and average the standard deviations of the 5 samples. 
    calculate the standard deviation of the 5 sample means you found in step 2. 
    This is a crucial step as it measures the variability of these sample means.

4) Calculate the Standard Error: 
    Finally, calculate the standard error, which is the standard deviation of the sample means (from step 3) 
    divided by the square root of the sample size (which is 1,000 in your example).

The formula for standard error is:
SE= s/âˆšn
    where s is the standard deviation of the sample means, and 
    n is the size of each sample.

This process estimates how much variability you can expect in the sample means compared to the true population mean.'''
